Helm uses a packaging format called charts.  
A chart is a collection of files that describe a related set of Kubernetes resources.  

A single chart can be used to deploy simple application and even to deploy a full web app stack.  

A chart is organized as a collection of files inside of a directory. 

The format of the chart will be as below

```
wordpress/
  Chart.yaml          # A YAML file containing information about the chart
  LICENSE             # OPTIONAL: A plain text file containing the license for the chart
  README.md           # OPTIONAL: A human-readable README file
  values.yaml         # The default configuration values for this chart
  values.schema.json  # OPTIONAL: A JSON Schema for imposing a structure on the values.yaml file
  charts/             # A directory containing any charts upon which this chart depends.
  crds/               # Custom Resource Definitions
  templates/          # A directory of templates that, when combined with values,
                      # will generate valid Kubernetes manifest files.
  templates/NOTES.txt # OPTIONAL: A plain text file containing short usage notes
```

To create own helm charts  
`helm create <chart name>`
